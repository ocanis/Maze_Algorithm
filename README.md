# Maze Solving

The next step up from simple line following is to push your 3pi to navigate paths with : 

* sharp turns, 
* dead ends, 
* and intersections. 

Make a : 
* complicated network of intersecting black lines, 
* add a circle to represent the goal, 
> and you have a line maze, which is a challenging environment for a robot to explore. 

In a line maze contest, robots travel as quickly as possible along the lines from a designated start to the goal, keeping track of the intersections that they pass along the way. Robots are given several chances to run the maze, so that they can follow the fastest possible path after learning about all of the dead ends.
